# RoofMaster


Hello! This is my WordPress template project that combines elements of a business card with a blog and includes a contact page. This template is designed with speed, responsiveness, and ease of use in mind, and its goal is to showcase my skills in creating WordPress templates.

This WordPress template features a simple, minimalist design that is easy to use and provides users with quick access to the information they need. In this project, I focused on ease of navigation, responsiveness, and fast loading times to provide users with the best possible experience.

INSTALLATION

To install this WordPress template, download the files from the GitHub repository and place them in the /wp-content/themes/ folder on your WordPress server. Then, activate this template in the "Appearance" section of the WordPress administrative panel.
